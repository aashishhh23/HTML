        <h2 id="bio">Biography</h2>
        <p>Linus Benedict Torvalds was born on December 28, 1969, in Helsinki, Finland. He developed an early interest in computers and programming, learning to code on a Commodore VIC-20. He later enrolled at the University of Helsinki, where he studied computer science.
            In 1991, while still a student, Linus began working on a small operating system as a personal project. He wanted a free alternative to UNIX and shared his work on an online forum. This project eventually became the Linux kernel, which is now the foundation of modern operating systems, cloud computing, and supercomputers.
